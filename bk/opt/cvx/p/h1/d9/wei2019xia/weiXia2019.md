I am an applied scientist working at Zillow. My work mostly focuses on vehicle routing problems and data analytics and modeling.

In 2018, I received my PhD degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. My research interests include quadratic programming and Copositive programming. I attribute much of my success to my advisor Luis Zuluaga who is an Associate Professor at Lehigh University. If you are looking for boring reads, you can find a copy of my dissertation here.

I spent 4 years in Virginia where I worked on my undergraduate program. By far Virginia is still one of my favorite places on earth.
